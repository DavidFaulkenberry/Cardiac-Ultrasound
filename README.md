# Cardiac-Ultrasound
    This repository displays the course long project generated in BME 543: Cardiac Ultrasound. This course, taught by the founder of 3D Ultrasound at Duke University, Dr. Olaf Von Ramm was comprised of two components. The first was an exploration of the functionality of Ultrasound systems and the software that has been used to analyze their results. The second occurred in the Duke Hospital and was taught by cardiac expert Dr. Joseph Kisslo. Here we studied cardiac anatomy and potential issues by reviewing real and often brand new patient data, by assessing issues in cadavers, and by dissecting a pig heart. 
    The product from this course was a group project where we were given the freedom to explore a software topic of our choosing, so long as it would provide meaningful results to the hospital. My group chose something that Dr. Von Ramm didn't believe had ever been attempted at the time, the left ventricle centroid. It was our belief that by analyzing the changes in left ventricle center of mass over a cardiac cycle that issues could be predicted by abnormalities. 
    In this repository our presentation of results and demonstrations, our final report and our fully functioning software that automates the calcultions of left ventricle volume, mass and centroid can be found.
